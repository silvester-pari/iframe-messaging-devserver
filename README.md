Start the individual dev servers and adapt the corresponding ports in the iframes:

- `vue-static`: just needs a simple http server
- `vue-vite`: `npm install` followed by a `npm run dev`
- `vue-webpack`: `npm install` followed by a `npm run serve`


Then, open the root-level index.html in a browser and check the resulting page.
