Start the individual dev servers and adapt the corresponding ports in the iframes:
`vue-static`: just needs a simple http server
`vue-vite`: `npm install` followed by a `npm run dev`
`vue-webpack`: `npm install` followed by a `npm run serve`

Then, open the root-level index.html in a browser and check the resulting page.
